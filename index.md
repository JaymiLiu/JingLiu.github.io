Currently, I work as a Senior Data Scientist at Walmart Labs Reston Office. I am skilled in data analysis, supervised learning, and deep learning (tensorflow and Pytorch). I am proficient in Pyspark, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and SQL. I also had experience in working with construction companies.

I received my doctoral degree from the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/), Canada in 2018. I also hold a master degree from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/) and a bachelor degree from [Southeast University](http://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). After graduation from the University of Alberta,  I have worked as a research associate in George Mason University (GMU) for one year with main focuses on [social media data mining](/JingLiu/data%20science/GNN/), [tabular data augmentation](/JingLiu/data%20science/GAN/), and [large-scale optimization problems](/JingLiu/data%20science/OPT/).
